## Read

Read contents of a NetCDF file into a data frame

The variable name needs to be specified. You can obtain it by doing `ncdump -h cwdx80_forcing_halfdeg.nc` in the terminal.

```{r}
df <- nc_to_df(
  here("data/cwdx80_forcing_halfdeg.nc"),
  varnam = "cwdx80_forcing"
  )

df
```

This contains `NA` for cells that have no values.

```{r}
df <- df |> 
  tidyr::drop_na()

df
```
